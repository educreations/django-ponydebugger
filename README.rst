django-ponydebugger
===================

`PonyDebugger`_ is a remote debugging toolset that uses Chrome Developer
Tools. It consists of 2 parts: a server (`ponyd`_) and an iOS client
library so you can debug your iOS apps.

This project adds a Python client for debugging `Django`_ web apps.

django-ponydebugger is licensed under the `MIT License`_.

Features
--------

-  Network Traffic Debugging

   View all requests received by Django, including request and response
   headers and bodies.

-  Console

   Interact with the running process with a fully functional console.

Installation / Setup / Usage
----------------------------

Install the django-ponydebugger package and its dependencies with the
following command:

::

    pip install django-ponydebugger

Update your Django settings module to add
``django_ponydebugger.middleware.PonyMiddleware`` to
``MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES`` (preferably near the beginning).

After receiving the first request, django-ponydebugger will connect to
ponyd. Connect to ponyd with your browser (probably
http://127.0.0.1:9000/), and you should see Django listed. After
clicking on Django, django-ponydebugger will report events to
PonyDebugger / Chrome Developer Tools.

Known Issues
------------

None

Future Work
-----------

-  Timeline support. It would be nice to report received HTTP requests
   as well as other events related to the request (like DB queries) to
   the Timeline.
